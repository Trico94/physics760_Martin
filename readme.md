# Computational physics 2020/2021

Hello and welcome to this repo. This repo was made for the computational physics course in WT 2020/2021. If you have any questions, let us know.

## Current Homework

### Homework 3
The third task, due for wednesday 15.11.2020 is located in the folder exercise 3. 
* We added a PDF-file that for the tutor called Exercise3_solution.pdf. The pages in the PDF are in landscape mode, to accomodate the large formulas. 
* It can happen, that the code in the PDF file is to long and therefore not completly depicted on the page. The complete code can be found in the jupyther notebook
* At one point a picture in the report is cut into half because of the page setup. The full pictures can either be found in the juypther notebook or the pictures folder in Exercise 3
* If it is still not possible to push to this repo, send a mail with the correction. It will then be pushed to the repo.
