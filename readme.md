# Computational physics 2020/2021

Hello and welcome to this repo. This repo was made for the computational physics course in WT 2020/2021. If you have any questions, let us know.

## Current Homework

### Homework 7
Again:
* All pictures are in the pictures folder
* If an equation is cut of it can be found in the jupyther notebook
* This should not happen to often, because the file is in landscape mode

Wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year!

## Old Homeworks

### Homework 1
The first task, due for wednesday 11.11.2020 is located in the folder exercise 1. 

### Homework 2
The second task, due for wednesday 18.11.2020 is located in the folder exercise 2. We added a pdf-file that for the tutor called Exercise2_solution.pdf. This file sometimes cuts the code if it is too long, but the code can be found in the Jupyther notebook exercise2.ipynb.

### Homework 3
The third task, due for wednesday 15.11.2020 is located in the folder exercise 3. 
* We added a PDF-file that for the tutor called Exercise3_solution.pdf. The pages in the PDF are in landscape mode, to accomodate the large formulas. 
* It can happen, that the code in the PDF file is to long and therefore not completly depicted on the page. The complete code can be found in the jupyther notebook
* At one point a picture in the report is cut into half because of the page setup. The full pictures can either be found in the juypther notebook or the pictures folder in Exercise 3
* If it is still not possible to push to this repo, send a mail with the correction. It will then be pushed to the repo.

### Homework 4
Instructions applieng for this homework, which was due to 02.12.2020, are basically the same as for homework 3. 
* A PDF file can be found in "Exercise 4" folder alongside with the Jupyther notebook.
* Images can be found in the pictures folder located in the "Exercise 4" folder. These images have a higher resolution than the ones in the PDF.
* If text is cut of in the PDF, it can be examined in the Jupyther Notebook.

### Homework 5
Homework 5 did not go as well as we wanted it to. The data structure is the same as before. 

### Homework 6
Homework 6 follows the same method as before:
* The pictures are in the picture folder
* The PDF-file is in landscape mode, because there were agian large formulas. If there is still a problem with readability the formulas can be checked out in the Jupyther notebook. 
* The data for the Jupyther notebook is in the data folder. We modified the data to use pandas to read it.
