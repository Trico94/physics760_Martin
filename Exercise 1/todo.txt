TODO-List:
-Since we work with units where kB = 1, what are the relevant dimensionless ratios in this problem?
-attempt to estimate the error of your estimate
    -maybe compare analytical with simulation
-Compare your numerical results to the exact solution to the “infinite volume” (also known as the “thermodynamic limit”)
